# syntax-analyser
Syntax analyser using a recursive decent parser. Tests if a program has correct syntax according to a simple made up programming language.

This project was part of my coursework at Lancaster University. We were provided with the following classes:
- Token.java
- CompilationException.java
- LexicalAnalyser.java
- AbstractGenerate.java
- AbstractSyntaxAnalyser.java
- Compile.java

My task was to implement the SyntaxAnalyser.java and Generate.java classes.
